<div>A tiger that had been captured by humans as a cub was released after several years of domestic life. Life among humans had not diminished his strength or his instincts; as soon as he was released, he ran into the jungle. Once in the jungle, his brothers, having him once again among them, asked him: "What have you learned?

    -What have you learned?The tiger meditated without haste. He wanted to transmit to them some wise, transcendent concept. He remembered a human comment: "Tigers are not immortal. They believe they are immortal because they ignore death, they ignore that they will die."
    
    Ah, thought the tiger to himself, that is a thought that will surprise them: we are not immortal, life is not eternal. -I learned this," he said at last, "We are not immortal, we are just unaware that we are ever going to die." ....
    
    The other tigers did not let him finish speaking, they pounced on him, bit his neck and watched him bleed to death. That's the problem with those who are sick to death," said one of the felines. They become resentful and want to infect everyone''.
